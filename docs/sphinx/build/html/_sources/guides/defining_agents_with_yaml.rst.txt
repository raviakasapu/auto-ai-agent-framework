Defining Agents with YAML (v1)
==============================

Agents are defined declaratively with a v1 schema featuring ``apiVersion``, ``kind``, ``metadata``, ``resources``, and ``spec``.

See also: ``docs/agent_config_schema.md`` in the repo for annotated examples.

Basic steps::

  - Create resources (tools, gateways) with ``name`` and ``type``
  - Reference resources by name in the ``spec``
  - Load with ``AgentFactory.create_from_yaml(path)``
