Concepts
========

Use this page to learn the mental model of the framework before building.

Core Objects
------------
- Agent: Orchestrates planning, tool calls, memory, and returns results.
- Tool: A typed, validated operation the agent can invoke.
- Planner: Chooses the next action (static, rules, or LLM‑routed).
- Memory: Conversation and long‑term context stores.
- Gateway: LLM provider abstraction (OpenAI, Google Generative AI, Anthropic, mock).
- Events: Structured traces for observability and debugging.

Lifecycle
---------
1. Load config (YAML v1) → instantiate resources
2. Build agent with tools, planner, memory, and gateway
3. Run agent with input → planner selects action(s) → tools execute
4. Emit events, update memory, return structured result

Configuration (YAML v1)
-----------------------
- tools: names map to registered implementations; include per‑tool settings
- model: provider + parameters (temperature, tokens)
- memory: conversation history, vector memory (optional)
- behavior: system prompt, stop conditions, guardrails
- env: read secrets from environment

Good Defaults
-------------
- Start with a single tool and StaticPlanner
- Keep prompts short and focused; prefer small configs first
- Add LLM routing only after a working baseline
