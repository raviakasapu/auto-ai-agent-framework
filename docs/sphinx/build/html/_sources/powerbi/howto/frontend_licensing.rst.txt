Frontend Licensing Integration
==============================

Goal
----
Integrate license checks in the frontend for gating features.

Approach
--------
- Centralize license fetch/validate in a service.
- Gate routes/components based on license state.
- Surface clear errors and recovery prompts.

Checklist
---------
- Fetch license on app init and cache in state.
- Show locked UI when license is missing/expired.
- Retry and refresh flows for transient errors.

Security
--------
- Do not expose secrets in the client.
- Validate license server responses and handle tampering gracefully.
