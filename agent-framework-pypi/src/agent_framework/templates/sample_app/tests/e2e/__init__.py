"""
End-to-End Tests (Tier 3)

These tests involve real LLM calls and test the full system behavior.
They require API keys and are more expensive to run.

Test Categories:
- test_golden_paths.py: Full scenario tests with real LLM
- test_validation.py: Error handling and self-correction
- test_robustness.py: Adversarial inputs and edge cases

Note: These tests require OPENAI_API_KEY to be set.
